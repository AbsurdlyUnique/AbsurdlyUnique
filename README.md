# 🧡 Sponsoring Svelte

Hey, I'm **Julian** — currently learning **Svelte 5** and supporting the amazing folks behind [Svelte](https://svelte.dev).

## Why?

Because:
- It's fast, elegant, and doesn't ship a JavaScript museum to the browser
- The compiler-first approach is 🔥
- I believe in tools that do **less** and achieve **more**

## What I'm doing

- Exploring the magic of **reactivity** without boilerplate
- Experimenting with **Svelte 5** features (like the new runes API)
- Refactoring side projects to drop frameworks that make me sad

## Sponsor Link

If you're a fan of fast, simple, and beautiful web apps — [consider sponsoring Svelte too](https://github.com/sponsors/sveltejs). It's worth it.
